Someone is joining you!
===============================================

Congradulations!

A new hitchhiker, <%= @hitchhiker.profile.name %>, is joining you for the trip, "<%= @trip.name %>", at <%= @trip.start_datetime.strftime("%m/%d/%y %I:%M %P") %>.

If you have any questions for the new passenger, you can send a private message by using this link: <%= url_for new_message_path(:receiver => @hitchhiker.profile.id, :only_path => false) %>.
You will want to want to introduce yourself to the new passenger to find out more about them and make them feel welcome.
